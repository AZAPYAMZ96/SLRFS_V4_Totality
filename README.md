Once you’ve added that and clicked **“Commit new file”**, your repository will have a clear front page showing your architecture and purpose.  

Would you like me to make that README more **academic (for ArXiv/Zenodo upload)** or **mythic-technological (for the iQ presentation style)** before you paste it?
