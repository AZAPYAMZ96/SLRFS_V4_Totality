# 🌊 Seel Lens Reef File System (SLRFS) — v4.0 Totality  

Unified **Seel Lens Reef File System architecture**, integrating across the iQ Vitality domains of physics, code, and perception.

---

## 🧠 Core Components  

- **Core Reef Vitality** — foundational flow structure for the Vitalium Index.  
- **Law Ledger Network** — 40+ iQ Laws defining balance, flow, and emergence.  
- **Vitality Codex Master Sequence** — canonical codex of vitality mathematics.  
- **Ocean & Reef Experiments** — empirical simulations validating resilience and flow continuity.  
- **Cross-Field Extensions** — links between vitality, topology, and mirror landscapes.
